0.6.10 version 22 nov 2009
===================================================================================================
FIX: hasContext() and fetch() methods correctly find contexts masked by IF/UNLESS blocks, 
     related bugs: #255, #260
FIX: possible double free crash for includes was fixed (bug #257)

===================================================================================================
0.6.9 version 19 oct 2009
===================================================================================================
FIX: "blitz.warn_context_duplicates" checking could cause coredumps (patch by Anton Dovgal)

===================================================================================================
0.6.8 version 13 march 2009
===================================================================================================
- New ini-variable "blitz.check_recursion" was added. Use this setting to 
  disable internal recursion check for recursive includes (for example, 
  when building hierarchical comment tree using template which includes itself). See bug
  #248 for details.
- Segfault in nested includes with user-defined functions was fixed (in some cases there could
  be a double free of method result at shutdown stage). See bug #245 for detais.

===================================================================================================
0.6.7 version 29 january 2009
===================================================================================================
- Infinite include loops checking was added (bug #241)
- blitz.path global should work fine with Windows-like systems ("C:/dir/" paths)
- Block method now affects contexts hidden by IF/UNLESS (bug #211)
- getStruct() returnes IF/UNLESS nodes correctly (bug #230)
- Internal method "unless" was added - an opposite pair to "if"

===================================================================================================
0.6.6 version 11 january 2009. С новым годом!
===================================================================================================
- New methods "assign" and "display" were added: "assign" is just the same as "set",
  and "display" executes template and outputs the result.
  $View->display($vars) is equal to echo $View->parse($vars).
- New ini-variable "blitz.warn_context_duplicates" was added. When it's set to 1 (default is 0)
  blitz generates warnings for context name duplicates by comparing full context paths.
- A couple of segfaults were fixed (fetch without parameters, bugs #242, #232)

===================================================================================================
0.6.5 version 21 october 2008
===================================================================================================
- Segfault on some "broken" templates was fixed

===================================================================================================
0.6.4 version 17 october 2008
===================================================================================================
- Variable prefix can be set to empty value by ini_set (bug #109)
- Predefined vars are outputted in single line if statement (bug #221)

===================================================================================================
0.6.3 version 13 october 2008
===================================================================================================
- Predefined, global and boolean vars were fixed in IF/UNLESS multi-line blocks (bugs #196, #213)
- Segfault fixed when setting array(NULL) value and setting anything else after (bug #225)

===================================================================================================
0.6.2 version 15 august 2008
===================================================================================================
- Path-variables ($object.property and $hash.key) in IF/UNLESS multi-line blocks were fixed and 
  corresponding tests were improved.
- Minor win32-compilation fixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.6.1 version 14 july 2008
===================================================================================================
Finally new 0.6 branch was started. Blitz will have a number of "heavy" features suggested
by users during last years. Well, better late than never! 
- IF/UNLESS multi-line blocks were added. The primary goal was to help users with usual
  header/footer/empty pattern. Now one can just use the following syntax:
  {{ IF list }}
  <table>
  {{ BEGIN list }}
      <tr><td>{{ $some }}</td></tr>
  {{ END }}
  </table>
  {{ END }}
  {{ UNLESS list }}
      Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling
  {{ END }}
- fixed bug with removing spaces around context tags (ticket #181)

===================================================================================================
0.5.13 version 30 may 2008
===================================================================================================
- internal methods policy was corrected, only two methods are restricted in user methods and
  templates: load and parse. This fixes bugs 116, 115

===================================================================================================
0.5.12 version 9 May 2008. С праздником, товарищи! Бей фашистскую сволочь.
===================================================================================================
- blitz.remove_spaces_around_context_tags = 1 removes extra whitespaces around
  standalone context tags (0 by default)

===================================================================================================
0.5.11 version 28 Feb 2008
===================================================================================================
fixed bugs:
- dynamic included file contexts do not parse (ticket #112)
- cannot successfully load php string from blitz subclass (ticket #111)
- including template with filename as name of variable {{ include($var) }} (ticket #104)
- string variables '0' or "0" are not false (ticket #99)
- unzipped source should be blitz-[$VERSION], not blitz (ticket #106)

===================================================================================================
0.5.10 version 25 Jan 2008
===================================================================================================
- fixed segfault on specific iteration sequences which use a mix of normal
  and simplified forms of set params (ticket #95)
- make non-prefixed "path"-varibles (obj.property or arr.key) work correctly
  in method calls (ticket #92)
- minor fixes to remove compilation warnings
- minor fixes in error messages

===================================================================================================
0.5.9 version 10 Jan 2008
===================================================================================================
- "safety" patch by Konstantin Baryshnikov (ticket #85)
    - blitz.disable_include = 1 disables include in templates (0 by default)
    - disallow calling internal methods from templates i.e. {{ parse() }}
- variables can be used without var_prefix in method calls (ticket #91)
  i.e. {{ do(something) }} is equal to {{ do($something) }}
- fixed boolean predicate in if statement
- minor changes in docs

===================================================================================================
0.5.8 version 23 Nov 2007
===================================================================================================
- bug#83 fixed, double free on include (tony)
- disallow double Blitz object initialization, test added (tony)
- english documentation was updated: sample fixes, getGlobals, getContext,
  getIterations, getStruct, predefined variables in loops $_even/$_odd/etc, 
  $object.property/$hash.key variables (fisher)

===================================================================================================
0.5.7 version 18 Oct 2007
===================================================================================================
Bug & memleak fixes by Antony Dovgal 

===================================================================================================
0.5.7-devel version 15 Oct 2007
===================================================================================================
Code clean-up: a part of "static" template structure (which doesn't depend on iterations) was
put into a separate attrubute called "static_data". This will help with caching issues in the
future.

===================================================================================================
0.5.6 version 24 Sent 2007
===================================================================================================
Bug#80 (if works incorrectly with undefined vars as predicate) was fixed.

===================================================================================================
0.5.5 version 29 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Lots of code cleanup was done. Experimental pack support was removed. Reading templates by mmap
was switched off by default. 

===================================================================================================
0.5.4 version 20 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Segfault when accessing uninitialized memory was fixed (bug#76). 

===================================================================================================
0.5.3 version 20 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Variable path ($hash.key.whatever.else, $obj.property.whatever.else) support was added. 
Each '.' points to a hash->value or object->property relation, both can be mixed in any way in 
varible path. This should work for any variable, global and local, 
in any place including user/predefined method arguments. Therefore setGlobals/set_globals may accept
non-scalar key values to make things like $config.param work, so optional second parameter 
warn_non_scalar became obsolete and was removed. See examples in tests/var_path.phpt. Tests were 
updated, they should work correctly in any environment (there were problems with file paths in
previous versions).

===================================================================================================
0.5.2 version 16 August 2007
===================================================================================================
TS & Win32 compilation fixes. Iniitialization varible 'blitz.path' support was added. When is't 
not empty all the filenames will be prefixed by this value if filename doesn't start with '/'.

===================================================================================================
0.5.1 version 12 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Lots of code cleanup was done. "parse" and "include" methods were improved, their "vars" argument 
is not a globals array anymore (old API), now it's just an arbitrary iteration set and both methods
comply with set/block/fetch. Templates included by "include" method from PHP code inherit globals 
from caller automatically. Corresponding tests were updated. A new article was added to the docs, 
"Quick Geek Blitz Tutorial", which is addressed to those professionals who want to get maximum 
information about API in a minimum of time.

===================================================================================================
0.4.25 version 03 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Predefined loop variables were added: $_total, $_num, $_even, $_odd, $_first, $_last - they can be 
used in any context. Variable $_total is the total number of context iterations, $_num is the 
current iteration number starting with 1, $_even and $_odd are 1 when the current 
iteration is even or odd and 0 otherwise, $_first and $_last are 1 when the current
iteration is first or last and 0 otherwise. Fixed bug#68 (nonexistant context iteration "cleans" 
previous data set in the root iteration). Fixed bug#69 (problems with date() function tests and 
optional second parameter).

===================================================================================================
0.4.24 version 28 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Predefined include method was improved: any include from template will use internal template 
cache (in previos versions this cache worked for controller include method only). 
"Context" method returns current context path, and new getContext/get_context method was added 
for the same purpose. Additional minor fixes were made, most of them related to win32 and 
multi-threaded issues. Some tests were updated and new tests were added.

===================================================================================================
0.4.23 version 22 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Very important include-related changes were made.
A template included by the "include" directive (not include method) will
inherit current context iterations. When you set
array('test' => array('var' => 'value')) into the root context
of a template which includes another template with a context named 'test',
this 'test 'context will be iterated with params from the parent template. 
To make this work properly, one have to use an additional non-empty 
parameter "iterate_nonexistant" (TRUE, 1, 'Yes' - whatever) in parent "iterate" 
or "block" calls, because normally non-existant contexts are not iterated 
since 0.4.20 (otherwise iterating non-existant contexts will automatically 
iterate the whole path). See tests/include_ctx.phpt for example. Additionally if we have a 
mix of numerical and non-numerical keys in iteration set a warning will be generated 
and non-numerical keys will be skipped. Several new tests were added and other minor 
fixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.22 version 12 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Block method semantics was extended: one can use block($data) instead of block(NULL,$data)
to iterate current context. Set method can accept arrays with numerical keys to 
set several root iterations simultaneously. Basic template examples were added to php_info(). 
A couple of new tests were added. 

===================================================================================================
0.4.21 version 09 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor fetch bugfixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.20 version 08 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Starting from this version Blitz "officially" supports lite variables assigning. One had to use
a "list" of arrays (array with numerical keys and array values) to set context iterations in previous 
versions. Now it's possible to use a "hash" of scalar/array values (array with string keys 
for variables or block iterations) for a single iteration - this makes the code much more clear. 
To have a single iteration of a context named "block", assigning a variable $var = "value", 
one can just say $data['block']['var'] = 'value' and then $View->set($data). This also worked 
in previos versions but in some cases like fetch this caused a segfault - now it's fixed. 
Additionally two minor bugs were fixed: current path is not iterated when iterating 
a nonexistent path, and there is no first empty iteration when the whole template is iterated 
cyclically by a root path '/'.

===================================================================================================
0.4.19 version 03 July 2007
===================================================================================================
New API methods getIterations/get_iterations and getGlobals/get_globals 
were added to get assigned template variables. Method alias setGlobals/set_globals 
for setGlobal/set_global was added to improve naming style (setGlobal/set_global still works). 
A bug in getStruct was fixed: nodes with errors are not returned. Alternative tags "<!--" and "-->" 
were extended by additional whitespace, new values are "<!-- " and " -->" (please convert your 
templates if you were using something like "<!--begin context-->").

===================================================================================================
0.4.18 version 23 June 2007
===================================================================================================
Bug #44 (naming conflicts) was fixed. getStruct()/get_struct() method was added to extend 
php_templates compatibility (getStruct method is a partial analog for the tmpl_structure function 
from php_templates extension, see samples/get_struct.php).

===================================================================================================
0.4.17 version 25 May 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor template parsing fixes were made (bugs## 40,41).

===================================================================================================
0.4.16 version 12 May 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor template parsing fixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.15 version 1 May 2007. С праздником, товарищи! Коси и забивай.
===================================================================================================
A segfault which occurred when undefined variables were used in output wrapper was fixed. 
Minor changes in tests and examples were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.14 version 28 Apr 2007
===================================================================================================
Documentation was updated. Minor php_templates compability fix: function calls without 
brackets are treated as variables with the same name by default. 

===================================================================================================
0.4.13 version 1 Apr 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor fixes in output wrappers were made (template syntax check was corrected,
ENT_NOQUOTES support added to "escape" method, default time for "date" method
is current time). Corresponding tests were updated.

===================================================================================================
0.4.12-1 version 31 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
A segfault which occurred when variables are set into root context after clean/fetch 
operations was fixed.

===================================================================================================
0.4.12 version 31 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
changes in "clean" method were made:
- "clean" removes all context iterations, not the latest one
- "clean" accepts second boolean parameter which says if blitz will throw PHP-warnings 
  when cleaning iteration is not found: $View->clean($path = '/', $warn_notfound = TRUE). 
  This parameter is TRUE by default.

Win32 compilation fixes (php_var_dump, php_parse_date) 

===================================================================================================
0.4.11 version 25 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
A new output wrapper "date" was added: {{ date([FORMAT], $arg); }} will return a string formatted 
according to the given format string. When $arg is numerical, it is treated as UNIX timestamp integer. 
Otherwise $arg is parsed using internal PHP function "php_parse_date" which recognize a lot of date 
formats. Format string has the same conversion specifiers as PHP function "strftime".

Output wrapper "escape" was extended: {{ escape($arg) }} will use ENT_QUOTES quoting style by 
default, while {{ escape($a, "ENT_COMPAT") }} will use ENT_COMPAT.

===================================================================================================
0.4.10 version 19 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- Clean method was added: $Tpl->clean($path) cleans up context iterations and parameters which were
  made previously. Parameter $path is "root" by default ('/'): $Tpl->clean() with no parameter
  will unset all template varibales and iterations.
- Minor parsing fixes were made (long HTML comments treated as alternative tags
  could cause "lexem is too long" warning since 0.4.4 version).

===================================================================================================
0.4.9. version 17 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- minor parsing fixes were made (context name for alternative END-tag is optional without 
any syntax warning)

===================================================================================================
0.4.8. version 13 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- non-brackets format method fix: {{ test }}

===================================================================================================
0.4.7 version 11 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- segfault on alternative context parsing fixed (HTML comments started with 
non-alpha-numeric characters)

===================================================================================================
0.4.6 version 27 Feb 2007
===================================================================================================
- syntax warning for HTML comments in alternative context format 
  mode (<!-- BEGIN ctx --> ... <!-- END ctx -->) was fixed 

===================================================================================================
0.4.5 version, 25 Feb 2007
===================================================================================================
- internal escape output wrapper was added: {{ escape($a); }}, 
  escape($a) works exactly like htmlspecialchars($a, ENT_QUOTES);

===================================================================================================
0.4.4 version, 11 Feb 2007
===================================================================================================
- [VERY IMPORTANT] lower/upper case policy changed. 
  varible and context names are case sensitive, method names - not.
- commonly used context format compatibility added: <!-- BEGIN ctx --> ... <!-- END ctx -->
- other minor fixes

===================================================================================================
0.4.3 version, 10 Dec 2006 
===================================================================================================
- bugfix#11: warning when calling undefined user method from template
- feature request#1: logical values in templates 
- feature request#2: END tag can be followed by any text {{ END some_template_name }}

===================================================================================================
0.4.2 version, 27 Nov 2006
===================================================================================================
- bugfix #3: occasionally uninitialized pargs element in user method call 
- bugfix #7: occasionally uninitialized parent_ctx_data in blitz_exec_nodes 
- fetch: cleans-up latest iteration automatically

===================================================================================================
0.4.1 version
===================================================================================================
- several context/iterate fixes (logical, very important Dick's issues)
- added has_context function
- removed dump_set function (dump_iterations can be used instead)
- removed pack-features for win32 (this code needs to be rewritten)
- OOP-style function aliases dumpStruct, dumpIterations,  hasContext, setGlobal
- new tests added, all tests are compatible with PHP5 now 
- ini-params renamed, they are: var_prefix, tag_open, tag_close ("tag", not "node")
- case insensitivity for contexts added

- my_method() is a valid call now (nothing in brackets)
- load(NULL) segfault fixed
- passing wrong parameters to iterate/parse (arrays are of wrong format) fixed
- dynamical realloc in blitz_analyze (segfault on big templates fix)
- segfaults on user method calling (method throws an exception, returned value corruption)
- empty template is not analyzed, and no warning is shown
- line/number border-value fixes in error messages 
- TSRM-related & win32 compilation fixes
- clean-up of passing arguments to user methods corrected

===================================================================================================
0.4.0 version 
===================================================================================================
- context-related functionality added (context, iterate, block, fetch, set_globals)
- human-readable errors (syntax, internal etc)
- dump functions for debugging: dump_struct, dump_set, dump_iterations
- T-cache (packed templates)
