===================================================================================================
0.7.1.16-devel 9 may 2012. С праздником, товарищи! Бей фашистскую сволочь.
===================================================================================================
This is very first release with HTML output escaping. Please note that internal html extension was 
improved in 5.4.0 and some features don't work in prior versions - mainly, substitution of 
disallowed unicode chars. Thus some tests should fail if you have PHP version < 5.4.0.

- CHANGE: basic filters support was added: {{ $var | filter }}, only "raw" and "escape"
    filters are supported and only for variables [#70]
- CHANGE: automatic output filtering is enabled with blitz.auto_escape = 1, 0 by default) [#70]
- CHANGE: blitz.charset global was removed (engine should use default PHP charset) [#70]
- FIX: incorrect $-prefixed variables throw errors [bug#307]

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.15-devel 21 mar 2012. С днём весеннего равноденствия!
===================================================================================================
- FIX: improved performance by removing unnecessary strlen call in internal 
       blitz_exec_var and blitz_exec_var_path functions
- FIX: fixed compilation error for PHP 5.4.*

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.14-devel 11 mar 2012. 
    С днём работника органов наркоконтроля, и днём работников геодезии и картографии!
===================================================================================================
- FIX: expressions didn't work properly with globals, undefined variables and constants
- CHANGE: VERY IMPORTANT! old setting "blitz.disable_include" (0 by default) was replaced
  by new "blitz.enable_include" (1 by default)
- ADD: news settings were added:
    * blitz.enable_callbacks - enables callbacks, PHP or user-defined
    * blitz.enable_php_callbacks - enables just PHP callbacks
    * blitz.php_callbacks_first - set highest priority to PHP callbacks when it's unclear
      if it's PHP callback or template object callback
- FIX: max tag content length was increased from 128 to 512 bytes

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.13-devel 9 dec 2011.
===================================================================================================
- CHANGE: various fixes for expressions support in IF/ELSEIF/ELSE/ULNESS statements.

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.12-devel 13 nov 2011. С днём войск радиационной, химической и биологической защиты!
===================================================================================================
- CHANGE: added simple expressions support for IF/ELSEIF/ULNESS statements.

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.11-devel 19 apr 2011
===================================================================================================
- FIX: segfault for tricky nested includes (bug#284).
- FIX: lowercasing for methods can be suppressed by a new variable blitz.lower_case_method_names. 
  By default, blitz.lower_case_method_names = 1 (bug#286).
- FIX: if with empty agrument causes syntax error (bug#287).
- CHANGE: new docs were added into the package.

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.10-devel 12 apr 2011. С 50-летием полёта человека в космос!
===================================================================================================
- FIX: all floats were "false" in conditions.
- FIX: segfault for deep nested includes and non-zero blitz.scope_lookup_limit.
- FIX: minor leaks in the include method.
- FIX: timelib functions were moved away (fixes famous "undefined symbol: timelib_time_ctor" issue).
- CHANGE: since now PHP4 is not supported anymore. This basically means that I won't break 
  anything just to have shiny OOP shit, and everything should work as usual, but I won't test 
  PHP4 compilation and won't fix related bugs. Nuff said.
- CHANGE: prepared the parser to use simple expressions. Just parser, not executor.
  This may cause strange behaviour: when you put valid expressions in IF/ELSE statements
  they neither work as expressions nor throw warnings. How this still works: 
  just first argument is checked to be non-empty.
  Example: {{ IF $a < 0 }} is still equivalent to {{ IF $a }}.

===================================================================================================
0.7.1.1-devel -> 0.7.1.9-devel
===================================================================================================
This was very new version with a lot of changes, optimizations and cleanups. I could
even forgot to mention something below. Please, be careful using these versions in production.

- CHANGE: new parser, analyzer and executor 
- ADD: context scope is increased now if blitz.scope_lookup_limit is set positive number.
  This number controls the deep - number of total hash-lookups from child to parent.
- ADD: comments were added (/* put comments in these tags */, you have to enable it
  with blitz.enable_comments and redefine these tags using
  blitz.tag_comment_open/blitz.tag_comment_close)
- ADD: IF/UNLESS were extended by ELSEIF/ELSE syntax
- ADD: More flexible method caller that allows plugins. Having {{ do($some) }} there is an 
  internal method check. If class method with the same name exists - this method is called.
  If not - caller executes this function as any other PHP function. Now you are totally free to use
  any PHP function calls from Blitz templates. {{ SomeCoolPlugin::func($some) }} works as well.
  You can use hints to tell blitz what do exactly: {{ php::do($some) }} calls php function do(),
  {{ this::do() }} calls do() method.
- CHANGE: blitz.remove_spaces_around_context_tags is 1 by default (this removes empty
  lines around your tags by default, be careful)
- CHANGE: blitz.path for Windows-like systems fixed ("C:\dir\" paths)
- FIX: MS WINDOWS compilation
- FIX: syntax error position was wrong for mostly all error messages 
- CHANGE: max length of any string between open/close (limited by BLITZ_MAX_LEXEM_LEN = 128)
  bytes (was 1024)
- CHANGE: block nesting is limited by BLITZ_ANALIZER_NODE_STACK_LEN = 64
- FIX: all function calls in templates are str_lower'ed correctly (was: only functions without brackets)

===================================================================================================
0.6.10 version 20 nov 2009
===================================================================================================
FIX: hasContext() and fetch() methods correctly find contexts masked by IF/UNLESS blocks, 
     related bugs: #255, #260
FIX: possible double free crash for includes was fixed (bug #257)

===================================================================================================
0.6.9 version 19 oct 2009
===================================================================================================
FIX: "blitz.warn_context_duplicates" checking could cause coredumps (patch by Anton Dovgal)

===================================================================================================
0.6.8 version 13 march 2009
===================================================================================================
- New ini-variable "blitz.check_recursion" was added. Use this setting to 
  disable internal recursion check for recursive includes (for example, 
  when building hierarchical comment tree using template which includes itself). See bug
  #248 for details.
- Segfault in nested includes with user-defined functions was fixed (in some cases there could
  be a double free of method result at shutdown stage). See bug #245 for detais.

===================================================================================================
0.6.7 version 29 january 2009
===================================================================================================
- Infinite include loops checking was added (bug #241)
- blitz.path global should work fine with Windows-like systems ("C:\dir\" paths)
- Block method now affects contexts hidden by IF/UNLESS (bug #211)
- getStruct() returnes IF/UNLESS nodes correctly (bug #230)
- Internal method "unless" was added - an opposite pair to "if"

===================================================================================================
0.6.6 version 11 january 2009. С новым годом!
===================================================================================================
- New methods "assign" and "display" were added: "assign" is just the same as "set",
  and "display" executes template and outputs the result.
  $View->display($vars) is equal to echo $View->parse($vars).
- New ini-variable "blitz.warn_context_duplicates" was added. When it's set to 1 (default is 0)

===================================================================================================
0.6.4 version 17 october 2008
===================================================================================================
- Variable prefix can be set to empty value by ini_set (bug #109)
- Predefined vars are outputted in single line if statement (bug #221)

===================================================================================================
0.6.3 version 13 october 2008
===================================================================================================
- Predefined, global and boolean vars were fixed in IF/UNLESS multi-line blocks (bugs #196, #213)
- Segfault fixed when setting array(NULL) value and setting anything else after (bug #225)

===================================================================================================
0.6.2 version 15 august 2008
===================================================================================================
- Path-variables ($object.property and $hash.key) in IF/UNLESS multi-line blocks were fixed and 
  corresponding tests were improved.
- Minor win32-compilation fixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.6.1 version 14 july 2008
===================================================================================================
Finally new 0.6 branch was started. Blitz will have a number of "heavy" features suggested
by users during last years. Well, better late than never! 
- IF/UNLESS multi-line blocks were added. The primary goal was to help users with usual
  header/footer/empty pattern. Now one can just use the following syntax:
  {{ IF list }}
  <table>
  {{ BEGIN list }}
      <tr><td>{{ $some }}</td></tr>
  {{ END }}
  </table>
  {{ END }}
  {{ UNLESS list }}
      Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling
  {{ END }}
- fixed bug with removing spaces around context tags (ticket #181)

===================================================================================================
0.5.13 version 30 may 2008
===================================================================================================
- internal methods policy was corrected, only two methods are restricted in user methods and
  templates: load and parse. This fixes bugs 116, 115

===================================================================================================
0.5.12 version 9 May 2008. С праздником, товарищи! Бей фашистскую сволочь.
===================================================================================================
- blitz.remove_spaces_around_context_tags = 1 removes extra whitespaces around
  standalone context tags (0 by default)

===================================================================================================
0.5.11 version 28 Feb 2008
===================================================================================================
fixed bugs:
- dynamic included file contexts do not parse (ticket #112)
- cannot successfully load php string from blitz subclass (ticket #111)
- including template with filename as name of variable {{ include($var) }} (ticket #104)
- string variables '0' or "0" are not false (ticket #99)
- unzipped source should be blitz-[$VERSION], not blitz (ticket #106)

===================================================================================================
0.5.10 version 25 Jan 2008
===================================================================================================
- fixed segfault on specific iteration sequences which use a mix of normal
  and simplified forms of set params (ticket #95)
- make non-prefixed "path"-varibles (obj.property or arr.key) work correctly
  in method calls (ticket #92)
- minor fixes to remove compilation warnings
- minor fixes in error messages

===================================================================================================
0.5.9 version 10 Jan 2008
===================================================================================================
- "safety" patch by Konstantin Baryshnikov (ticket #85)
    - blitz.disable_include = 1 disables include in templates (0 by default)
    - disallow calling internal methods from templates i.e. {{ parse() }}
- variables can be used without var_prefix in method calls (ticket #91)
  i.e. {{ do(something) }} is equal to {{ do($something) }}
- fixed boolean predicate in if statement
- minor changes in docs

===================================================================================================
0.5.8 version 23 Nov 2007
===================================================================================================
- bug#83 fixed, double free on include (tony)
- disallow double Blitz object initialization, test added (tony)
- english documentation was updated: sample fixes, getGlobals, getContext,
  getIterations, getStruct, predefined variables in loops $_even/$_odd/etc, 
  $object.property/$hash.key variables (fisher)

===================================================================================================
0.5.7 version 18 Oct 2007
===================================================================================================
Bug & memleak fixes by Antony Dovgal 

===================================================================================================
0.5.7-devel version 15 Oct 2007
===================================================================================================
Code clean-up: a part of "static" template structure (which doesn't depend on iterations) was
put into a separate attrubute called "static_data". This will help with caching issues in the
future.

===================================================================================================
0.5.6 version 24 Sent 2007
===================================================================================================
Bug#80 (if works incorrectly with undefined vars as predicate) was fixed.

===================================================================================================
0.5.5 version 29 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Lots of code cleanup was done. Experimental pack support was removed. Reading templates by mmap
was switched off by default. 

===================================================================================================
0.5.4 version 20 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Segfault when accessing uninitialized memory was fixed (bug#76). 

===================================================================================================
0.5.3 version 20 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Variable path ($hash.key.whatever.else, $obj.property.whatever.else) support was added. 
Each '.' points to a hash->value or object->property relation, both can be mixed in any way in 
varible path. This should work for any variable, global and local, 
in any place including user/predefined method arguments. Therefore setGlobals/set_globals may accept
non-scalar key values to make things like $config.param work, so optional second parameter 
warn_non_scalar became obsolete and was removed. See examples in tests/var_path.phpt. Tests were 
updated, they should work correctly in any environment (there were problems with file paths in
previous versions).

===================================================================================================
0.5.2 version 16 August 2007
===================================================================================================
TS & Win32 compilation fixes. Iniitialization varible 'blitz.path' support was added. When is't 
not empty all the filenames will be prefixed by this value if filename doesn't start with '/'.

===================================================================================================
0.5.1 version 12 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Lots of code cleanup was done. "parse" and "include" methods were improved, their "vars" argument 
is not a globals array anymore (old API), now it's just an arbitrary iteration set and both methods
comply with set/block/fetch. Templates included by "include" method from PHP code inherit globals 
from caller automatically. Corresponding tests were updated. A new article was added to the docs, 
"Quick Geek Blitz Tutorial", which is addressed to those professionals who want to get maximum 
information about API in a minimum of time.

===================================================================================================
0.4.25 version 03 August 2007
===================================================================================================
Predefined loop variables were added: $_total, $_num, $_even, $_odd, $_first, $_last - they can be 
used in any context. Variable $_total is the total number of context iterations, $_num is the 
current iteration number starting with 1, $_even and $_odd are 1 when the current 
iteration is even or odd and 0 otherwise, $_first and $_last are 1 when the current
iteration is first or last and 0 otherwise. Fixed bug#68 (nonexistant context iteration "cleans" 
previous data set in the root iteration). Fixed bug#69 (problems with date() function tests and 
optional second parameter).

===================================================================================================
0.4.24 version 28 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Predefined include method was improved: any include from template will use internal template 
cache (in previos versions this cache worked for controller include method only). 
"Context" method returns current context path, and new getContext/get_context method was added 
for the same purpose. Additional minor fixes were made, most of them related to win32 and 
multi-threaded issues. Some tests were updated and new tests were added.

===================================================================================================
0.4.23 version 22 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Very important include-related changes were made.
A template included by the "include" directive (not include method) will
inherit current context iterations. When you set
array('test' => array('var' => 'value')) into the root context
of a template which includes another template with a context named 'test',
this 'test 'context will be iterated with params from the parent template. 
To make this work properly, one have to use an additional non-empty 
parameter "iterate_nonexistant" (TRUE, 1, 'Yes' - whatever) in parent "iterate" 
or "block" calls, because normally non-existant contexts are not iterated 
since 0.4.20 (otherwise iterating non-existant contexts will automatically 
iterate the whole path). See tests/include_ctx.phpt for example. Additionally if we have a 
mix of numerical and non-numerical keys in iteration set a warning will be generated 
and non-numerical keys will be skipped. Several new tests were added and other minor 
fixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.22 version 12 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Block method semantics was extended: one can use block($data) instead of block(NULL,$data)
to iterate current context. Set method can accept arrays with numerical keys to 
set several root iterations simultaneously. Basic template examples were added to php_info(). 
A couple of new tests were added. 

===================================================================================================
0.4.21 version 09 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor fetch bugfixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.20 version 08 July 2007
===================================================================================================
Starting from this version Blitz "officially" supports lite variables assigning. One had to use
a "list" of arrays (array with numerical keys and array values) to set context iterations in previous 
versions. Now it's possible to use a "hash" of scalar/array values (array with string keys 
for variables or block iterations) for a single iteration - this makes the code much more clear. 
To have a single iteration of a context named "block", assigning a variable $var = "value", 
one can just say $data['block']['var'] = 'value' and then $View->set($data). This also worked 
in previos versions but in some cases like fetch this caused a segfault - now it's fixed. 
Additionally two minor bugs were fixed: current path is not iterated when iterating 
a nonexistent path, and there is no first empty iteration when the whole template is iterated 
cyclically by a root path '/'.

===================================================================================================
0.4.19 version 03 July 2007
===================================================================================================
New API methods getIterations/get_iterations and getGlobals/get_globals 
were added to get assigned template variables. Method alias setGlobals/set_globals 
for setGlobal/set_global was added to improve naming style (setGlobal/set_global still works). 
A bug in getStruct was fixed: nodes with errors are not returned. Alternative tags "<!--" and "-->" 
were extended by additional whitespace, new values are "<!-- " and " -->" (please convert your 
templates if you were using something like "<!--begin context-->").

===================================================================================================
0.4.18 version 23 June 2007
===================================================================================================
Bug #44 (naming conflicts) was fixed. getStruct()/get_struct() method was added to extend 
php_templates compatibility (getStruct method is a partial analog for the tmpl_structure function 
from php_templates extension, see samples/get_struct.php).

===================================================================================================
0.4.17 version 25 May 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor template parsing fixes were made (bugs## 40,41).

===================================================================================================
0.4.16 version 12 May 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor template parsing fixes were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.15 version 1 May 2007. С праздником, товарищи! Коси и забивай.
===================================================================================================
A segfault which occurred when undefined variables were used in output wrapper was fixed. 
Minor changes in tests and examples were made.

===================================================================================================
0.4.14 version 28 Apr 2007
===================================================================================================
Documentation was updated. Minor php_templates compability fix: function calls without 
brackets are treated as variables with the same name by default. 

===================================================================================================
0.4.13 version 1 Apr 2007
===================================================================================================
Minor fixes in output wrappers were made (template syntax check was corrected,
ENT_NOQUOTES support added to "escape" method, default time for "date" method
is current time). Corresponding tests were updated.

===================================================================================================
0.4.12-1 version 31 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
A segfault which occurred when variables are set into root context after clean/fetch 
operations was fixed.

===================================================================================================
0.4.12 version 31 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
changes in "clean" method were made:
- "clean" removes all context iterations, not the latest one
- "clean" accepts second boolean parameter which says if blitz will throw PHP-warnings 
  when cleaning iteration is not found: $View->clean($path = '/', $warn_notfound = TRUE). 
  This parameter is TRUE by default.

Win32 compilation fixes (php_var_dump, php_parse_date) 

===================================================================================================
0.4.11 version 25 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
A new output wrapper "date" was added: {{ date([FORMAT], $arg); }} will return a string formatted 
according to the given format string. When $arg is numerical, it is treated as UNIX timestamp integer. 
Otherwise $arg is parsed using internal PHP function "php_parse_date" which recognize a lot of date 
formats. Format string has the same conversion specifiers as PHP function "strftime".

Output wrapper "escape" was extended: {{ escape($arg) }} will use ENT_QUOTES quoting style by 
default, while {{ escape($a, "ENT_COMPAT") }} will use ENT_COMPAT.

===================================================================================================
0.4.10 version 19 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- Clean method was added: $Tpl->clean($path) cleans up context iterations and parameters which were
  made previously. Parameter $path is "root" by default ('/'): $Tpl->clean() with no parameter
  will unset all template varibales and iterations.
- Minor parsing fixes were made (long HTML comments treated as alternative tags
  could cause "lexem is too long" warning since 0.4.4 version).

===================================================================================================
0.4.9. version 17 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- minor parsing fixes were made (context name for alternative END-tag is optional without 
any syntax warning)

===================================================================================================
0.4.8. version 13 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- non-brackets format method fix: {{ test }}

===================================================================================================
0.4.7 version 11 Mar 2007
===================================================================================================
- segfault on alternative context parsing fixed (HTML comments started with 
non-alpha-numeric characters)

===================================================================================================
0.4.6 version 27 Feb 2007
===================================================================================================
- syntax warning for HTML comments in alternative context format 
  mode (<!-- BEGIN ctx --> ... <!-- END ctx -->) was fixed 

===================================================================================================
0.4.5 version, 25 Feb 2007
===================================================================================================
- internal escape output wrapper was added: {{ escape($a); }}, 
  escape($a) works exactly like htmlspecialchars($a, ENT_QUOTES);

===================================================================================================
0.4.4 version, 11 Feb 2007
===================================================================================================
- [VERY IMPORTANT] lower/upper case policy changed. 
  varible and context names are case sensitive, method names - not.
- commonly used context format compatibility added: <!-- BEGIN ctx --> ... <!-- END ctx -->
- other minor fixes

===================================================================================================
0.4.3 version, 10 Dec 2006 
===================================================================================================
- bugfix#11: warning when calling undefined user method from template

- my_method() is a valid call now (nothing in brackets)
- load(NULL) segfault fixed
- passing wrong parameters to iterate/parse (arrays are of wrong format) fixed
- dynamical realloc in blitz_analyze (segfault on big templates fix)
- segfaults on user method calling (method throws an exception, returned value corruption)
- empty template is not analyzed, and no warning is shown
- line/number border-value fixes in error messages 
- TSRM-related & win32 compilation fixes
- clean-up of passing arguments to user methods corrected

===================================================================================================
0.4.0 version 
===================================================================================================
- context-related functionality added (context, iterate, block, fetch, set_globals)
- human-readable errors (syntax, internal etc)
- dump functions for debugging: dump_struct, dump_set, dump_iterations
